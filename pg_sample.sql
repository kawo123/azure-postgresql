--
-- 12. Index
-- Optimizes query performance by reducing need for full table scan
-- B-tree: balance tree, used for high cardinality columns
-- Bitmap: low cardinality columns, read-intensive workload, created on the fly when beneficial
--         Pro: optimizes bitwise filtering
--         Con: index update is slow
-- Hash: used for equality, comparable performance as B-tree, discouraged by PostsgreSQL communities (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/indexes-types.html)
--       Pro: index size is smaller, may fit in memory
-- PG-specific indexes: GIST, SP-GIST, GIN, BRIN
-- GIST: generalized search tree; framework for implementing custom indexes
-- SP-GIST: space-partitioned GIST; used for nonbalanced data structures
-- GIN: text indexing; faster lookup but slower build than GIST; 2-3x larger than GIST
-- BRIN: Block range indexing; used for large data sets; divides data into ordered blocks
--

create index idx_rental_customer_id on rental(customer_id);

explain
analyze
select *
from rental;

explain
analyze
select *
from rental
where customer_id > 500;

drop index idx_rental_customer_id;

--
-- 13. Partitioning
-- Large tables are difficult to query efficiently even with indexes
-- Horizontal Partitioning: split table by rows into partitions; Pro: limit scans to subset of partitions; commonly used in DW, timeseries db, etc
-- Vertical Partitioning: split columns into multiple tables; Pro: reduce I/O; commonly used in DW, data w. many attributes, etc.
-- Range Partition: parition on range (e.g. date, numeric range, alphabetical range)
-- List Partition: partiton on list of values
-- Hash Partition: partition using modulo (available on PG 11+)
--

create table iot_measurement(
	location_id int not null
	, measure_date date not null
	, temp_celsius int
	, rel_humidity_pct int
) partition by range (measure_date);

create table iot_measurement_wk1_2019
partition of iot_measurement
for values from ('2019-01-01') to ('2019-01-08');

create table iot_measurement_wk2_2019
partition of iot_measurement
for values from ('2019-01-08') to ('2019-01-15');

drop table iot_measurement;

--
-- 14. Materialized View
-- Pre-computed queries; update to source requires update to materialized view
-- Pro: usedful when query time is more important than storage space
--

create materialized view mv_film_inventory as
select
	f.film_id
	, f.title
	, i.inventory_id
from
	film as f
inner join
	inventory as i
on
	f.film_id = i.film_id;

select * from mv_film_inventory;

refresh materialized view mv_film_inventory;

drop materialized view mv_film_inventory;
